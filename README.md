## 🛠️ Technologies Used

-  Next.js: React-based framework for building web applications

## 🎮 Gameplay

In Space Dash, you control a rocket that must avoid boulders falling from the top of the screen. The movement of your hand controls the rocket’s position in real-time. As you progress, the difficulty increases with more boulders appearing and faster movements.

-  Move your hands left or right to control the rocket.
-  Dodge the falling boulders and rack up distance points.
-  Collide with a boulder, and you’ll lose a life—avoid losing all your lives to keep playing!
